# Section 2: ABuilding and implementing CI/CD pipelines for a service

## 2.1 Design CI/CD pipelines:

### Immutable artifacts with Container Registry

### Artifact repositories with Container Registry

### Deployment strategies with Cloud Build, Spinnaker

### Deployment to hybrid and multi-cloud environments with Anthos, Spinnaker, Kubernetes

### Artifact versioning strategy with Cloud Build, Container Registry

### CI/CD pipeline triggers with Cloud Source Repositories, Cloud Build GitHub App, Cloud Pub/Sub

### Testing a new version with Spinnaker

### Configure deployment processes (e.g., approval flows)

## 2.2 Implement CI/CD pipelines:

### CI with Cloud Build

### CD with Cloud Build

### Open source tooling (e.g. Jenkins, Spinnaker, GitLab, Concourse)

### Auditing and tracing of deployments (e.g., CSR, Cloud Build, Cloud Audit Logs)

## 2.3 Manage configuration and secrets:

### Secure storage methods

### Secret rotation and config changes

## 2.4 Manage infrastructure as code:

### Terraform / Cloud Deployment Manager

### Infrastructure code versioning

### Make infrastructure changes safer

### Immutable architecture

## 2.5 Deploy CI/CD tooling:

### Centralized tools vs. multiple tools (single vs multi-tenant)

### Security of CI/CD tooling

## 2.6 Manage different development environments (e.g., staging, production, etc.):

### Decide on the number of environments and their purpose

### Create environments dynamically per feature branch with GKE, Cloud Deployment Manager

### Local development environments with Docker, Cloud Code, Skaffold

## 2.7 Secure the deployment pipeline:

### Vulnerability analysis with Container Registry

### Binary Authorization

### IAM policies per environment
