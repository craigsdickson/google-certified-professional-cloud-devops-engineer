# Section 4: Optimizing service performance

## 4.1 Identify service performance issues:

### Evaluate and understand user impact (Stackdriver Service Monitoring for App Engine, Istio)

### Utilize Stackdriver to identify cloud resource utilization

### Utilize Stackdriver Trace/Profiler to profile performance characteristics

### Interpret service mesh telemetry

### Troubleshoot issues with the image/OS

### Troubleshoot network issues (e.g., VPC flow logs, firewall logs, latency, view network details)

## 4.2 Debug application code:

### Application instrumentation

### Stackdriver Debugger

### Stackdriver Logging

### Stackdriver Trace

### Debugging distributed applications

### App Engine local development server

### Stackdriver Error Reporting

### Stackdriver Profiler

## 4.3 Optimize resource utilization:

### Identify resource costs

### Identify resource utilization levels

### Develop plan to optimize areas of greatest cost or lowest utilization

### Manage preemptible VMs

### Work with committed-use discounts

### TCO considerations

### Consider network pricing
