# Section 5: Managing service incidents

## 5.1 Coordinate roles and implement communication channels during a service incident:

### Define roles (incident commander, communication lead, operations lead)

### Provide regular status updates, internal and external

### Record major changes in incident state (When mitigated? When all clear? etc.)

### Establish communications channels (email, IRC, Hangouts, Slack, phone, etc.)

### Scaling response team and delegation

### Avoid exhaustion / burnout

### Rotate / hand over roles

### Manage stakeholder relationships

## 5.2 Investigate incident symptoms impacting users:

### Identify probable causes of service failure

### Evaluate symptoms against probable causes; rank probability of cause based on observed behavior

### Perform investigation to isolate most likely actual cause

### Identify alternatives to mitigate issue

## 5.3 Mitigate incident impact on users:

### Roll back release

### Drain / redirect traffic

### Turn off experiment

### Add capacity

## 5.4 Resolve issues (e.g., Cloud Build, Jenkins):

### Code change / fix bug

### Verify fix

### Declare all-clear

## 5.5 Document issue in a postmortem:

### Document root causes

### Create and prioritize action items
