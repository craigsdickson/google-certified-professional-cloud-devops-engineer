# Section 3: Implementing service monitoring strategies

## 3.1 Manage application logs:

### Collecting logs from Compute Engine, GKE with Stackdriver Logging, Fluentd

### Collecting third-party and structured logs with Stackdriver Logging, Fluentd

### Sending application logs directly to Stackdriver API with Stackdriver Logging

## 3.2 Manage application metrics with Stackdriver Monitoring:

### Collecting metrics from Compute Engine

### Collecting GKE/Kubernetes metrics

### Use metric explorer for ad hoc metric analysis

## 3.3 Manage Stackdriver Monitoring platform:

### Creating a monitoring dashboard

### Filtering and sharing dashboards

### Configure third-party alerting in Stackdriver Monitoring (i.e., PagerDuty, Slack, etc.)

### Define alerting policies based on SLIs with Stackdriver Monitoring

### Automate alerting policy definition with Cloud DM or Terraform

### Implementing SLO monitoring and alerting with Stackdriver Monitoring

### Understand Stackdriver Monitoring integrations (e.g., Grafana, BigQuery)

### Using SIEM tools to analyze audit/flow logs (e.g., Splunk, Datadog)

### Design Stackdriver Workspace strategy

## 3.4 Manage Stackdriver Logging platform:

### Enabling data access logs (e.g., Cloud Audit Logs)

### Enabling VPC flow logs

### Viewing logs in the GCP Console

### Using basic vs. advanced logging filters

### Implementing logs-based metrics

### Understanding the logging exclusion vs. logging export

### Selecting the options for logging export

### Implementing a project-level / org-level export

### Viewing export logs in Cloud Storage and BigQuery

### Sending logs to an external logging platform

## 3.5 Implement logging and monitoring access controls:

### Set ACL to restrict access to audit logs with IAM, Stackdriver Logging

### Set ACL to restrict export configuration with IAM, Stackdriver Logging

### Set ACL to allow metric writing for custom metrics with IAM, Stackdriver Monitoring
