# Section 1: Applying site reliability engineering principles to a service

## 1.1 Balance change, velocity, and reliability of the service:

### Discover SLIs (availability, latency, etc.)

### Define SLOs and understand SLAs

### Agree to consequences of not meeting the error budget

### Construct feedback loops to decide what to build next

### Toil automation

## 1.2 Manage service life cycle:

### Manage a service (e.g., introduce a new service, deploy it, maintain and retire it)

### Plan for capacity (e.g., quotas and limits management)

## 1.3 Ensure healthy communication and collaboration for operations:

### Prevent burnout (e.g., set up automation processes to prevent burnout)

### Foster a learning culture

### Foster a culture of blamelessness
